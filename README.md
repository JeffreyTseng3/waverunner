# Wave Runner


A side-scrolling platform game that renders audio waveforms and obstacles for the user to bypass

## Coding Languages and Tools
+ Javascript 
+ p5
+ CSS3 

## Resources
+ Sprite Sheets (https://www.spriters-resource.com/custom_edited/sonicthehedgehogcustoms/)

## Difficulties
The difficulties for this project include the following
+ Player Controls 
+ Collision Detection
+ Stage Rendering 

## Player Controls
The user controlled hero is controlled by left/right/jump inputs and whether or not the
user is touching a platform, out-of-bounds, or hitting an enemy object. 

## Collision Detection 
To accomplish this, I determine whether or not the user's sprite is within the bounds of another object of interest. 

## Stage Rendering
Rendering the stage required multiple items, sprite sheets for platforms, rings, and enemies, and some musical analysis to render waveforms.
